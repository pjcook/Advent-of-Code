     So MAX X should be the last X position in your targetArea because with a single trajectory, you could jump to that X position i.e. you could jump directly into the target area. And the MIN Y should be the smallest Y value from your targetArea.
     X can never be 0 (unless your target area has a negative X range), or it wonâ€™t move and will never get into the target area.
     The maximum Y value on the other hand is a little more tricky, so I just made an assumption that the absolute value of the lowest Y position from the targetArea would likely do.

     The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any integer velocity in the x (forward) and y (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial x,y velocity like 0,10 would fire the probe straight up, while an initial velocity like 10,-1 would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.

     The probe's x,y position starts at 0,0. Then, it will follow some trajectory by moving in steps. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:

     The probe's x position increases by its x velocity.
     The probe's y position increases by its y velocity.
     Due to drag, the probe's x velocity changes by 1 toward the value 0; that is, it decreases by 1 if it is greater than 0, increases by 1 if it is less than 0, or does not change if it is already 0.
     Due to gravity, the probe's y velocity decreases by 1.
