# Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com

Advent of code is an amazing adventure into computer programming. It starts with some slightly more straight forwards problems to solve, and quickly escalates to significantly more challenging problems. 

Solving problems is a coders dream, and advent of code is an amazing challenge. It's also a fantastic learning opportunity to stretch your imagination and core programming skills.

This repository it my attempts at these challenges.

My source code is open so that anyone else can view my code for learning purposes.
